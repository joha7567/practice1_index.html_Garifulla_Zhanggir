            NiKo is Bosnia and Herzegovina's main young star after pita. He started his career in CS 1.6, but did not manage to achieve anything significant. With the transition to CS: GO, he played exclusively for Balkan teams such as iNation, GamePub and aimface, where he stood out very much among his teammates. This was noticed by mousesports, and in April 2015 the Bosnian was invited to join mouz. However, two months later, Nicola was moved to a replacement position. During this time, he managed to help in the role of replacing Team Kinguin at the qualifications of Gaming Paradise, as well as SK Gaming at IEM Gamescom.

Only in February 2017, NiKo changed his team, moving to FaZe Clan. And only recently he joined G2.
